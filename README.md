This repository contains all code and data files for my thesis in Economics 191: Topics in Economics Research. The final thesis can be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BSe_AgGeOTk4YhJ9DtOGTHyhySMb2MBz/view?usp=sharing). I used .ipynb notebooks for data cleaning, R markdown notebooks for running the final regressions and overleaf to type up the final document. Apologies for the messiness in the organization, this was my first time working on a significant research project. I only made this repository as a form of record-keeping, well after the thesis had been submitted.
